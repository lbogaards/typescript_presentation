# Breakout in Typescript
This demo uses the excalibur.js library. This code was also copied and
adapted from one of the demo projects.

## Getting started
Install https://atom.io/
Install https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript
Open this directory in atom
Compile: save a file or press F6 to compile the entire project
Open index.html in a browser and play breakout. Then play around with the code.

## Playtime
Just some ideas to get you started. Let us know if you run into trouble.

 * Implement a way to win the game (you can only lose).
 * Factor out game state logic from ball.ts
 * Make the ball round.
 * Speed up the ball after each ball loss.
 * Refactoring: find out which fields in Config are not used by removing them and compiling.
 * Learn about tsconfig.json.
 * See what happens when you put your cursor on ex.Actor (first line brick.ts) and press F12. Learn about the .d.ts file.
 * Add dependency injection.
 * Add a second level with a second row of bricks.
